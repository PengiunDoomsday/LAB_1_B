Assignment:Lab 1-B - Recursion
Last Modification: 09/13/2018
Program Purpose: The purpose of this program is to practice recursive algorithm problem
solving andbuilding. by Using methods built in to the provided NLTK and PRAW software we 
can access Reddit submission and break down their comment and reply trees into traversable 
data. We must implement a recursive algorithm to process all comments and designate
them to appropriate lists based on the results of NLTK's Sentiment analysis.
